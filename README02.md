#### Practical tasks:

1. Get a new account on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) if you don't have one yet.
2. Complete all [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) tasks from Front End Development Certification.
3. Create Trivia-like Quiz:

## Create a custom client for Trivia Quiz API: http://jservice.io/

#### Your simple app should contain:

1. Simple headers with total questions counter, correct answers score, text of the question, question ID and category.
2. Game field with answer container and letter container.

#### Each time user loads your app, clicks Next Question or Skip Button he gets a question with shuffled answer letters bellow. He is able to give answer for the question or skip to next.

##### User stories:

1. As a user I can get a question and see shuffled letters/symbols of true answer bellow.
2. As a user I can interact with any letter to begin answering, I wont see the error message until I finished answering.
3. I can see error or success message if my answer is finished.
4. I can see the real answer for the question in Dev Console.
5. I can Skip answering with Skip Button and go to Next Question with Next button if my answer was correct.

##### If this task looks way to easy for you, you can take bonus user stories:

1. As a user I can drag any letter to an answering slot.
2. I can Drag n Drop my letter back to letter picking area whenever I needed.

##### FEEL FREE CUSTOMIZE YOUR APP AND EXTEND ITS FUNCTIONALITY

##### You can use any frameworks or libraries you want or don't use them at all.

##### Suggested literature:

*If you don't feel confident completing these tasks, you may go through entire or some parts of Freecodecamp training map*

**After the job will be done, in your "kottans_web_test" repository create a folder "task_2" with README.md file. In this file add a direct link to your Freecodecamp account with completed challenges mentioned above. Also deploy your Trivia app via [gh-pages](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-website) (Simply create gh-pages branch on remote if your app doesn't need any building stuff) and put a link in your README.md file**

## To prevent crucial problems with gh-pages deploy, use https protocol in your AJAX request link (https://jservice.io/api/random). You will get a warning about insecure connection (cause trivia doesn't support https) but you will get a response.

## Good luck, folks!

When you finish this task you can start the next one:
