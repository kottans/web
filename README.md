#### P.S. If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become part of a small family and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this friendship, as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split a parts and create news courses like that(and we’ll never stop).
