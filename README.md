# General requirements

1. You will make a repository on GitHub and save your progress in it. More on repositories in task 0 (see below).

1. Styling: it's up to you, but remember to make it readable. Using [markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) is a good idea. 

3. Reading: for each article you are required to read please post the answsers to the following questions in your respective repo:
  - name (at least) one thing that was new to you
  - name (at least) one thing that surprised you
  - name (at least) one thing you will use in the future

Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect on what you have lerned.

4. Online courses: finish all tasks, make screenshots and post them in respective task's README.

5. Videos: same as for reading - watch the video, answer three questions.


# Task 0 (get familiar with Git and Github):

1. Watch [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

3. Finish the course [How to use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

7. [Join the gitter chat if you haven't done so yet :) ](https://gitter.im/Kottans/web?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

[Test 1](https://github.com/Kottans/web/blob/master/README01.md)

#### P.S. If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become part of a small family and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this friendship, as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split a parts and create news courses like that (and we’ll never stop).
